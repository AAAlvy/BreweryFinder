#Q1 Project (*app title is a work-in-progress*)

#No Skunky Works
######(possible titles include: *Which Brewery?* and *Where to Beer?*.

##This app will assist social beer drinkers in selecting a brewery to visit depending on their particular priority.

##The *Which Brewery* app will bridge the gap between individual beer ranking apps with more general crowd-source review apps to provide a narrowed-down list of breweries for the user to select from.

##The typical user will be a beer enthusiast who wants to seek out whichever brewery that also provides other specific interests at the time.

##The *Which Brewery* app will produce a list of brewery's near a user's desired location.

##The user will input their present or desired destination location.

##It will output a list of breweries that best match their criteria.

##It will use the APIs of Brewery DB or Untappd).

##*Which Brewery* will employ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Materialize.

##  Features on *Which Brewery* will include: a landing page with buttons that allow you to determine what kind of search you want to conduct. These buttons will be labeled and lead to appropriate pages, such as: search by name, quick location search, or search by rating factors. Based upon which search option the user chooses, a feature page of "results" will be produced.
